# Demo-Tracker Sample Placeholders

Add the following audio sample files (16-bit WAV recommended) to this folder so the Demo-Tracker can load them at runtime:

- `lead-sample.wav` — Bright saw lead at middle C.
- `bass-sample.wav` — Rounded triangle bass at middle C (C2 suggested).
- `vocal-yeah.wav` — Short synthetic vocal "Yeah" hit.
- `drum-kick.wav` — Punchy kick drum.
- `drum-snare.wav` — Snare with noise snap.
- `drum-hat.wav` — Tight closed hi-hat.
- `drum-clap.wav` — Layered clap sample.
- `drum-tom.wav` — Low floor tom.
- `drum-cymbal.wav` — Long ride cymbal.

Ensure each file name matches exactly so the tracker configuration in `config/config.json` can locate the samples.
